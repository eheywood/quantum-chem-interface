Educational Quantum Computing Interface to aid Teaching Quantum Chemistry

A tool-box to play around with simulations on different quantum computing backends. Currently the only circuit implemented is the Particle in a Box Model.

## Notes on adding more simulations:
All circuits must use 'meas' as the register name for measurements.
