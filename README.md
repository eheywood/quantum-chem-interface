# quantum-chem-interface

An educational tool-box to play around with quantum chemistry simulations on different quantum computing backends. Backend options include a cirq implemented QVM, a qiskit implemented QVM and interfacing with IBM Quantum. Currently the only circuit implemented is the Particle in a Box Model.

### To Do
- Add circuit optimisations into particle in a box circuit generation
- Bug fix particle in a box simulation
- GUI to display results
- Implement a free particle simulation
